# Glory to Rome

[Glory to Rome](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/19857/glory-rome) goes online (but nothing to do with Corona)

We try to put the board game "Glory to Rome " online, as a online PvP game.

 We use Kubernetes to orchestrate the microservices applications. The main language used for API development is vanilla Go.
